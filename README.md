## PyBank

For this assignment we were asked to read a csv file into Python and run an analysis on it. In doing so, we not only had to read the different elements of the data, which was simply the profit or loss for a bank from month to month, into lists but also had to iterate through the data to find the incremental change from period to period in order to find not only the average change but the largest and the smallest profit for the period. 

The results for this analysis was also outputted to a *txt* file. These results were verified in a separate Python file (PyBank_pandas_check.ipynb) where the same csv file was transformed into a Dataframe using *Pandas* which allowed for ease of analysis. 

## PyRamen

This optional assignment asked us to compare the menu data and the sales data for a restaurant in order to find the revenue, profit and cost of goods sold for a given period. While I was able to make some progress in terms of reading these csv files into Python and iterating through them to initialize the necessary variables, I was not able to complete the assignment.
